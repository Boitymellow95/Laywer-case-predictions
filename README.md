Lawyer Performance Prediction Project
Description

This project involves analyzing a synthetic dataset that describes the performance of lawyers at a particular law firm over the last month. The main objective is to predict the number of cases a lawyer will handle this month based on several features, including their performance last month, age, rank within the firm, and the number of sick days taken in the last year.
Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following variables:

    CTM: Cases this month (Target variable)
    CLM: Cases last month
    AGE: The lawyer's age
    SDY: Number of sick days taken in the last year
    LVL: The lawyer's rank within the firm, with possible ranks being:
        Associate
        Senior Associate
        Junior Partner
        Senior Partner
        Named Partner

Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to build predictive models that can estimate the number of cases a lawyer will handle this month (CTM) using the other variables in the dataset. The project is divided into the following tasks:
1. Single Variable Regression

    Predict CTM using each of the following variables individually:
        CLM (Cases last month)
        AGE (Lawyer's age)
        LVL (Lawyer's rank)
        SDY (Sick days last year)
    For each model, assess how well it fits the training and test data.
    Calculate and report the training R-squared values.
    Create scatter plots with a line showing the fit.

2. Multiple Variable Regression

    Use multiple variable regression techniques to build a predictive model using a combination of the available variables.
    Experiment with different combinations of variables and determine which model works best.
    Demonstrate iterations with different variable choices and explain why some models performed better than others.
    Provide plots of errors for each model.

3. Model Improvement and Justification

    Discuss whether each model improves on the previous one and justify the choice of the subsequent model.
    Analyze whether the chosen models make logical sense given the context of the problem.

4. Model Evaluation

    Use heuristics like scatter plots, AIC/BIC, and other relevant metrics to evaluate and support the models.
    Try feature engineering to create new variables that might improve the model's performance.
    Explain the rationale behind the chosen features and models.

5. Feature Engineering

    Experiment with creating new features that could improve the overall model performance.
    Justify the choice of these features and discuss their impact on model performance.

6. Final Model Discussion

    Summarize the performance of the final models.
    Discuss whether the models chosen make sense in the context of predicting lawyer performance.

Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

    Load the dataset.
    Perform single variable regression.
    Perform multiple variable regression.
    Evaluate models using various heuristics.
    Experiment with feature engineering.
    Analyze and discuss the results.

Results

The results of the analysis will include:

    R-squared values for each regression model.
    Scatter plots showing the fit of each model.
    Error plots for multiple regression models.
    A discussion on the best-performing models and why they were chosen.

Conclusion

This project aims to demonstrate how different regression techniques can be applied to predict lawyer performance based on various factors. The results and discussions will provide insights into the effectiveness of these techniques and the practical significance of the chosen models.
