    "We will perform single variable regression on the provided dataset to predict CTM using each of the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) CLM: Cases Last Month\n",
    "(b) AGE: Lawyer Age\n",
    "(c) LVL: Lawyer Level\n",
    "(d) SDY: Sick Days Last Year\n",
    "\n",
    "For each model, we will evaluate the fit on the training data and test data using R-squared and visualize the fit with a scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) CLM vs. CTM\n",
    "\n",
    "    This model attempts to predict CTM based on the lawyer's caseload from the previous month (CLM). A good fit would indicate a correlation between a lawyer's performance in one month and the next.\n",
    "    The R-squared value for the training data will indicate how well the model captures the linear relationship between CLM and CTM in the training set. A higher R-squared suggests a better fit.\n",
    "    The test data R-squared will assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. Ideally, the test R-squared should be close to the training R-squared.\n",
    "    A scatter plot of CTM vs. CLM with a fitted regression line will visually represent the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) AGE vs. CTM\n",
    "\n",
    "    This model explores the relationship between a lawyer's age and their caseload this month (CTM). A positive correlation might suggest more experience leads to handling more cases, while a negative correlation could indicate age-related slowdown.\n",
    "    The training R-squared will show how well the model captures the linear trend between age and CTM in the training data.\n",
    "    The test R-squared will assess the generalizability of the age-based prediction to unseen data.\n",
    "    A scatter plot of CTM vs. AGE with a fitted regression line will visualize the association between these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) LVL vs. CTM\n",
    "\n",
    "    This model investigates the influence of a lawyer's level (LVL) on their caseload this month (CTM). A positive association might suggest senior lawyers handle more cases.\n",
    "    Since LVL is a categorical variable (Associate, Senior Associate, etc.), we would need to convert it into numerical values for regression analysis. This could be done using dummy variables.\n",
    "    The training R-squared will indicate how well the model captures the relationship between LVL (represented by numerical values) and CTM in the training data.\n",
    "    The test R-squared will assess the generalizability of the level-based prediction to unseen data.\n",
    "    While a scatter plot wouldn't be ideal for categorical data, we could visualize the distribution of CTM for each lawyer level using boxplots or other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) SDY vs. CTM\n",
    "\n",
    "    This model explores the relationship between the number of sick days taken (SDY) and the lawyer's caseload this month (CTM). A negative correlation might suggest more sick days lead to handling fewer cases.\n",
    "    The training R-squared will show how well the model captures the linear trend between SDY and CTM in the training data.\n",
    "    The test R-squared will assess the generalizability of the sick day-based prediction to unseen data.\n",
    "    A scatter plot of CTM vs. SDY with a fitted regression line will visualize the association between these variables."
